# OpenGIVr (OpenGL Image Viewer)
## Libraries Used
### glad (with KHR folder)
### GLFW
### GLM
### dear ImGui
### stb_image
## App Overview
### So this app is literally made for viewing images in OpenGL.It's an experimental app tho.OpenGL is an overkill for such an easy task like this but i just made this app to try it.I can't tell it's the best for viewing images but still stands out in different aspects.The app lacks of a file dialog system because i simply couldn't find a way to make it both work for windows and linux.So i just decided to make a textbox where you can type your image path and it will access that path to get the image using stb_image.
